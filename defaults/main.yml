# This hash defines all the libvirt networks that should be created
# The example below defines a bridge and nat network.
# The bridge network is needed for ocp3 installs, IdM and anything else that needs direct
# access to the host network.
# The nat network is primarly for OCP4. Perhaps it will be use for other things in the furture.
# If there are other types of networks you want to support, make sure
# to create the associated libvirt network xml template
